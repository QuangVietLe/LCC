# LCC
All the results and programming related to our research paper, "Observations on circuits in a variant of the Collatz Graph".

The Trivial Files details the cycles that are generated from applying g to a however many times, then applying the original collatz function to it until it reaches back to a, for a = 1,2,8, or 16.
The Any File details the cycles found by systematically going through many possible tuples and manually checking if they satisfy the LCF or not, which includes trivial tuples.
